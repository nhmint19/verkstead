//! The zero state: what Verkstead is when there is nothing to list.
//!
//! It is a fact about the sidebar's list rather than about onboarding, so every
//! test here says what it is by what it serves for that list: nothing on it, and
//! the page is the compose page across the whole window; something on it, and
//! the pane is back with the compose page beside it. Nobody here is a fresh
//! install — the machine is set up in all of them, which is what makes the
//! state a fact about the list rather than about the machine.
//!
//! What decides it is `src/workbench/zero.ts`, read by the two pages that care:
//! the workbench, which has nowhere to be with an empty sidebar, and the compose
//! page, which draws the sidebar or does without it.
