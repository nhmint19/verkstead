//! The browse dropdown a path is written with: what steers it, what a tap on a
//! row does, and how a browse ends.
//!
//! Driven straight rather than through a page, the way the listbox's own tests
//! are — what is asked here is the control's own, so no settings query and no
//! save is in the way of the answer. The three fields that draw it on the
//! settings page are asked about where those fields are, in `paths.test.tsx`.
//!
//! Three things are worth a test rather than a reading of the source:
//!
//! - **What the rows are.** The dropdown is the entries of the deepest
//!   directory the field's own text names, filtered by whatever follows the
//!   last separator. Nothing else says which directory is being looked at, so
//!   a wrong reading of the text is a dropdown showing somebody another
//!   directory entirely.
//! - **What a tap does.** It writes the path into the field *and* opens it.
//!   Both, in one press: a tap that only wrote would leave the browse where it
//!   was, and one that only opened would leave the field saying nothing about
//!   where the human had got to.
//! - **How a browse ends.** The human closes it and the field keeps whatever it
//!   holds. There is no picking here, so a close that changed the field would
//!   be the one way to leave with something nobody typed or tapped.
//! - **Where a browse begins.** A field standing empty asks for no path at all,
//!   and what the server answers that with is its own home. A starting point
//!   rather than a ceiling: the way back out of it is a row like any other, so
//!   nothing above the home is out of reach.
//! - **What a field looking for a repository does with one.** It marks it and
//!   stops there — the Repos' form is being filled in with a repository, so one
//!   is the end of that browse rather than another level of it.
//! - **What a field shows of what came back.** The endpoint lists the whole of a
//!   directory and each field says which of it a human sees: the files, where
//!   the field names one, and the dotfiles, where the field points at one. Rows
//!   a field cannot hold are rows offered for nothing, and a file it can hold is
//!   where its browse arrives rather than another level of it.
//!
//! The listing of `/home/ada/src` is the fixture the server's own tests wrote,
//! so what the rows are drawn from is the shape the endpoint really answers
//! with — a repository among the directories, a file and a dotfile among the
//! rows to be left out. The levels above it are written here, being nothing but
//! more of the same shape.
