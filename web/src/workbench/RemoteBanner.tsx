//! The banner that points at Remote access: the one line above the Timeline
//! that says the human need not stay at this desk.
//!
//! **It is drawn in one window and nowhere else**: a Conversation that is
//! Grilling, with a session running, and with no Question Set on its Timeline
//! yet. That is the stretch while the first Set is being *prepared* — the first
//! moment there is nothing at the desk to do — and it closes the moment a Set
//! lands, because a Set waiting is something to do rather than a moment to be
//! told about answering from a phone.
//!
//! So it comes back at the next grilling start, and the one after, until
//! somebody says they have read it. Which is what makes the dismissal worth
//! keeping: a line that reappeared for ever would be one nobody reads.
//!
//! **And the dismissal is the server's**, read back on every load — see
//! `remoteBannerDismissed` in `../api/client`. The whole of what this banner is
//! for is a human standing at a desk who is about to pick up a phone, and a
//! dismissal kept in this browser would meet them again on the very device it
//! had just pointed them at.
//!
//! Nothing is asked for outside the window. The read is gated on the same
//! condition the banner is drawn on, so a Conversation that is not being
//! grilled costs no request at all — and a Conversation that is spends one, on
//! a key every page of the workbench shares.
