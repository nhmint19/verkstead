//! Reading one directory for a path field's dropdown: what is in it, and what
//! each of those things is.
//!
//! One directory per ask and no walking: a field browses by asking again for
//! each level somebody drills into, so nothing here ever recurses and a
//! directory holding ten thousand files costs one `read_dir`.
//!
//! One question, asked of every field: what is at this path. Nothing bounds it
//! but what the server can read, which is a wider disclosure than anything else
//! here makes and was settled as one — a field that could not reach the
//! directory it is about to be pointed at would be a field nobody could fill
//! in, and every path field is now one of those.
//!
//! **An ask with no path opens on the server's own home directory**, that being
//! where the human's repositories and the account an Agent Profile names both
//! most often are. A starting point rather than a ceiling: the listing walks up
//! out of it like any other directory — see [`list`], and [`topmost`] for what a
//! server with no home to read opens on instead.
//!
//! Nothing here refuses by status code. A path that is relative, missing, not a
//! directory or unreadable is a named outcome the dropdown draws where its rows
//! would be — see [`DirectoryListing`]. A field is typed into a character at a
//! time, so most of those are the ordinary state of a field halfway through a
//! word rather than anything that went wrong.
