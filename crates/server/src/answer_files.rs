//! The files the human puts on an Answer: the upload the answer sheet's
//! paperclip makes, and the removal its × makes.
//!
//! The Brief's own pair said again from the other page — see
//! [`crate::conversations::attach`], which is where the same two acts are made
//! for the Brief. What differs is three things and nothing else.
//!
//! **What they are addressed by.** A Set rather than a Conversation: the sheet
//! is a page about one Set, and the human answering it may never have seen the
//! Conversation it was asked from. Which Conversation that is is read here, off
//! the Set, because the file itself has only one place to go — the one flat
//! directory of the Conversation's own, with the Brief's files beside it, the
//! same cap over it and the same counting-up of a name already taken. A file
//! named like one of the Brief's becomes `name-2.ext`, which is the directory
//! answering rather than anything here deciding.
//!
//! **What they are refused by.** The Brief's freeze is the work starting; this
//! one is the Set settling. A Set that has been answered or locked unanswered
//! is the record of what the human sent, and a Closed Conversation is one
//! nothing is going to act on — so each of the three is refused by name, and
//! everything else about a Set is beside the point. A Deferred Ask takes files
//! like any other: nobody is idling on it, and the human answering it is doing
//! exactly what they would be doing on any other.
//!
//! **What a label has to be.** A file put on an Answer names the Question it
//! answers, and the Question has to be one the Set asks — see
//! [`verkstead_schema::QuestionSet::asks`], which is the reading a Response is
//! checked against. A Heading asks nothing of its own, a Set does not carry
//! every label somebody could type, and a Set this build cannot read asks
//! nothing anybody here can name: all three are one refusal, because all three
//! are a file put where no Answer would ever draw it.
