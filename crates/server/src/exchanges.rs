//! One Set and its Answers, written out as the markdown a prompt carries.
//!
//! Two things prime a session with an exchange the human has already had, and
//! they are the same writing job: a relaunched grilling, which is owed
//! everything already settled (see [`crate::grillings`]), and a Deferred Ask
//! whose Answers came back after the session that asked had finished (see
//! [`crate::deferrals`]). What differs between them is which Sets they gather
//! and what they say over the top; what a Set and its Response read as in a
//! prompt is one thing, and it is written here once.
