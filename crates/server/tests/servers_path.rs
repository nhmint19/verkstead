//! The `PATH` a session gets is the `PATH` the server itself was started with,
//! read once — asked of the real process rather than of a stated machine.
//!
//! **One test in a binary of its own, and that is the whole design of this
//! file.** What is being asserted is that the read happens once and that both
//! the sandbox builder and the onboarding probes are handed what it read, and
//! the only way to show a value has stopped following the environment is to
//! move the environment and look again. `std::env::set_var` is `unsafe` under
//! this edition because it races every other thread in the process reading one
//! — so there is one test here, and no other thread to race.
//!
//! Everything else about the composing is a unit test beside the function that
//! does it, where a `PATH` and a home are values a test hands over: see
//! `sandbox::composed`, which is what this file is the one process-level
//! reading of.
//!
//! Unix only. What is set here is a `HOME` and a colon-separated `PATH`, and
//! the Windows arm neither composes nor reads either — see the same module's
//! `a_windows_session_is_given_the_machines_own_path_rather_than_a_list`.
