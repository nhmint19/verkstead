//! What the Remote access section is drawn from: what this machine's Tailscale
//! is doing, read off the machine at the moment the pane is opened.
//!
//! Nothing here is a setting. Every field is what two commands said a moment
//! ago, which is why there is no stored half to reconcile against: a tailnet
//! joined from a terminal, or a `tailscale serve` somebody set up by hand, reads
//! here exactly as one set up from this page would.
//!
//! **Three answers rather than two**, because a machine with no `tailscale` on
//! it and a machine whose daemon is not answering want different things done
//! about them — one is an install and the other is a `tailscale up` — and
//! neither of them is *serve is off*. So the state the pane narrows on says
//! which of the three it is, and only the third one carries a node name and a
//! serve state at all.
//!
//! **And a fourth that is neither**: an answer this build cannot read. The JSON
//! `tailscale status` prints is documented as subject to change between
//! releases, and Tailscale is whatever the host has rather than anything this
//! repository pins — so a shape that is not recognised says so, rather than
//! being folded into the nearest state that happens to have room for it. The
//! serve state carries the same fourth answer for the same reason: a serve
//! configuration that could not be read is *cannot tell*, never *off*, because
//! *off* is what the switch beside it would offer to turn on.
//!
//! `trouble` is what the machine said, verbatim wherever there were words to
//! take — the line `tailscale` printed on standard error is the one that names
//! the systemd unit to start, and no sentence written here would be as useful.
//!
//! **And the one thing here that is pressed rather than read**: the serve
//! switch. It runs `tailscale serve` and answers with the machine read again,
//! so the position it settles at is a reading like every other field on this
//! page. Its own third answer is the operator grant — see [`ServePress`].
//!
//! **The login link rides along with the address**, because it is the address
//! with the Workbench Key on it and the key is the one thing the browser has
//! not got: the cookie carrying it is `HttpOnly`, so a page cannot build the
//! link it is about to draw as a QR code. Re-issuing the key answers with the
//! whole reading again — see [`RemoteView::Up`] — so that the QR and the link
//! beside it redraw on the new one rather than being asked for a second time.
//!
//! **And one field that is not about the machine at all**: whether the human is
//! done with the banner that points at this section — see [`RemoteBanner`]. It
//! is the one thing here that is stored rather than read off `tailscale`, and it
//! is here because what it is about is Remote access rather than any of the
//! Conversations the banner is drawn on.
